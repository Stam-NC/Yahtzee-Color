# Yahtzee-Color
This is my Yahtzee game written in C for a class. This program went beyond the specifications by including a color UI with color indicators, an option menu, game play options, and a table to hold the scores. 

This program will run in visual studio, and is intended to work on Windows 10 and 11. It will not work on Linux due to the use of Windows.h library.
